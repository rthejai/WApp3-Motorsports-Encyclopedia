# WApp3-Motorsports-Encyclopedia
For TINFO 431A by Thejai Riem

This is my new project idea. I scrapped my last idea which was a shopping cart site, because I felt like It was not going to be fun
to do. My new project is called Motorsports Encyclopedia. It is a listing of track and race cars all around the world in different types
of motorsports. Cars that are listed on site can then be assigned to companies and to tracks that they ran on with their lap times if
applicable.

There will be around 5-7 databases depending on how I handle the inheritance.
At a minimum 3 databases will be connected, but it will probably be more at 4 or 5 databases talking to each other.
Inheritance will be handled through the website registration where a regular user can only view cars and companies. A company owner
will be the next level where they can add cars and only delete cars within their company. The last type of user is the website Administrator
which will have full access to CRUD operations.
Once the back-end is finished I will make a different front-end with pictures of each car, track, and company logos to be displayed on the
final website.

What is done so far in terms of coding is adding the basic 3 databases including: Car, Tracks, and Track Enrollments. Basic CRUD operations
have also been added to the Car database with sorting.
